DDP-project
===========

My submission for the project of Developing Data Projects.

PERSONAL NOTE: This app is *very* basic, and was purely made as a proof-of-concept. I started these courses a bit late, did them at double speed, and am rushing to get this in before the deadline to be eligible for the fall Capstone Project. I had to cut back on more advanced and fun functions in the app.

The app has taken Reproducible Data's Storm project, and shows destruction for a specific year and type.

The app runs here: https://hdooster.shinyapps.io/DDP-project/
